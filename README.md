This was a game I created for an English project in my sophomore year. It is based off of Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. Its gameplay was inspired by The Oregon Trail. The game sees you leading a party from Oklahoma to California, while managing your gas, food, money, and health. The objective of the game is to reach Bakersfield, California. To play, download all files to the same folder and then compile and run GrapesOfWrath.java. Made by Adrian Li
